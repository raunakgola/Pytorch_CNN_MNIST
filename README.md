## Hello there i have created a Convolutional neural network in Pytorch.
### this model accuracy id 98.96% on MNIST digit dataset. There are 4 Convolution layers and in the end we visualise the feature maps of the filter of all conv layers.

## This is the arcitecture of my model for that i use Netron app to convert model architecture to png.
